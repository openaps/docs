# Phase 1: Data Collection
Phase 1 focuses on accessing, logging, cleaning up, and analyzing data from the pump and CGM. Data fidelity is extremely important, especially when dosing is being considered. Take the time to review what the openaps tools are outputting and carefully compare the logs against your own CareLink and CGM reports.

* Upon Completion
    * Be able to download, record, and recall data logs from pump and CGM
    * Be able to download “real time” data
    * Have data being sent via wireless connection to a cloud database for user access
    * Have built a system able to collect data and be able to help others do the same


* Phase Tasks
    * Use tools to download data from pump and CGM
    * Log data for future analysis, use in algorithms
    * Ensure fidelity and accuracy of recorded readings
    * Test edge cases
    * Log data “in real time” to test hardware functionality
    * Set up cloud database to accept uploaded data (optional)
    * Have logged data syncing to cloud database (optional)


* Community Contribution
    * Provide feedback on ...
