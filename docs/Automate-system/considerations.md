#Automating your system

At this stage, you should have a suitable algorithm to manually recommend necessary changes to basal rates. This is essentially a practice closed-loop system, with you completing the loop by manually calculating what you would do in that scenario. Now, you're ready to automate your loop. This section focuses on creating a schedule to collect data from the pump and cgm, calculate IOB and a temp basal suggestion, and then enact that on the pump. Again, at this stage testing is critical and output of the system should be tracked and validated over a series of time, and include thorough edge case testing to ensure that the loop is working, the schedule is as designed, and that you can quick-check when the system is running and trouble shoot any runtime challenges.
