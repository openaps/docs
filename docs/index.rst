# Introduction

Welcome to the [openaps](https://github.com/openaps/) documentation!

This documentation supports implementing a self driven, Do It Yourself (DIY) artificial pancreas, based on the [OpenAPS Reference Design](http://openaps.org/open-artificial-pancreas-system-openaps-reference-design/). By proceeding to use these tools or any [openaps](https://github.com/openaps/) repositories, you agree to abide by the copyright agreement and release any contributors from any liability. You assume full responsibility for all actions and outcomes related to use of these tools or ideas. [Please read the copyright agreement before proceeding](https://github.com/openaps/docs/blob/master/license.txt).

----------
## A Note on DIY and the Open Part of OpenAPS

This is a set of development tools to support a self driven DIY implementation of an open source artificial pancreas, OpenAPS. Any individual choosing to use these tools is solely responsible for testing, verifying, and implementing each of these tools independently or together as a system.

The [DIY part of OpenAPS is important](http://bit.ly/1NBbZtO). A growth and learning mindset is required to work with the "building blocks" that will help develop your OpenAPS system. **This is not a set and forget system**; an OpenAPS system requires persistent attention. Users must do blood glucose tests frequently and watch continuous glucose monitors vigilantly, in order to ensure each piece of the system is monitoring, predicting, and controlling blood glucose safely, given user defined constraints. The performance and quality of your OpenAPS system relies solely on you.

This community of contributors believes in paying it forward, and individuals who are implementing these tools are asked to contribute by asking questions, [helping improve this documentation](docs/docs/Resources/my-first-pr.md), and contributing in other ways.
