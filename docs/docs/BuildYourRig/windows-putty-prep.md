# Windows Users: Getting PUTTY so you can access your rig

### **1-1 Prepare Windows Computer**

- Install the [Intel Edison drivers for Windows]( https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/edison/downloads). Select the "Windows standalone driver" download. After it is done downloading, click on the downloaded file and it will execute installation.

- Install [PuTTY]( http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html). PuTTY is the program you will normally use to login to your rig in the future from the computer.  Creating a desktop shortcut for it is a good idea, since you will likely use it often.  Download the installation file that matches your PC's architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).  If you are unsure, you can check your computer's build and memory in the Control Panel.  Example shown is for a 64-bit computer.  If unsure, installing the 32-bit version won't harm anything...it just might be a little slower to use PuTTY.

### **1-2  Prepare Edison**
Now we move to the Edison.  You’ll see two microB USB ports on your explorer board.  One is labeled OTG (that’s for flashing) and one is labeled UART (that’s for logging into the Edison from a computer).  We will need to use both to flash.  We’re going to plug both of those into our computer’s USB ports using the cables listed in the parts list (Dexcom’s charging cable will work too).

Once you plug in the cables, you should see your Edison board pop-up as a connected “device”.  If you don’t…try different cables.

 - Go to Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Device Manager\Ports\ and look for USB Serial Port COMXX. If you have multiple and unsure of which is the port you need: Make note of existing ports. Unplug the cable from the Explorer Board. Notice which port disappears. this is the port you are looking for.  If only one shows up, that is your Edison's port.

  - Open PuTTY, change from SSH to Serial. It normally defaults to COM1 and speed of 9600. Change the COM number to the number you found when you plugged into the Explorer Board. Change the speed (baud rate) to 115200. 
  - Once you've made those changes, Click on OPEN at the bottom of your Putty configuration window.

 - Once the screen comes up, press enter a few times to wake things up. This will give you a "console" window of what is happening on your Edison. Move that window over to the right side of your screen without resizing it, if you can.  (We are going to open another window later on the left side.)
- Now you will see a login prompt for the Edison on the console screen. Login using the username "root" (all lowercase) and no password.

Head back to the other directions to continue the setup.
