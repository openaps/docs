# Loops In Progress

To get you comfortable with submitting a "PR" (stands for pull request), test it out by submitting a PR to this page, adding your name to the list of people who have loops in progress. This way we know how many people are in the development phase, too.

New to Github, and PRs? [Check out how to submit your first PR](../../../../docs/docs/Resources/my-first-pr.md).

When you submit the PR, be sure to target the *dev* branch of openaps/docs, not the master branch.  If you target master, we'll need to ask you to re-submit, or it will likely cause a merge conflict with edits from people who correctly targeted dev.
