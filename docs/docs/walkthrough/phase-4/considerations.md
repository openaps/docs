# Phase 4: Iterating on Your Closed Loop

Now that you're looping, congrats! Make sure you follow these steps - you're not done yet. You'll want to let us know that you are looping, and continue testing.

You in particular may want to test over a 24 hour period in the course of 3 days (doesn't have to be consecutive) to see what the system does when you do meal boluses with the system on, if you are interested in looping during the day.

Watching the system over long periods of time will help you continue to tweak how you bolus for meals and adjust baseline basals.

At this point, you can also investigate some of the in-development advanced features, like meal-assist and auto-sensitivity adjustment. You can also explore some of the hardware pieces in progress, as noted on the hardware page.
