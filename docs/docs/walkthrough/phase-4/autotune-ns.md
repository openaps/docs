# Using Autotune without OpenAPS

[Autotune](autotune.md) is a feature created in late December 2016 and is currently in beta (early testing) mode in the oref0 dev branch.  You can also see issue [#261](https://github.com/openaps/oref0/issues/261) and [#99](https://github.com/openaps/oref0/issues/99) and pull request [#313](https://github.com/openaps/oref0/pull/313) for background reading.


This page is currently a stub, copied from the main [Autotune](autotune.md) page.  Please update it with the steps required to spin up a new cloud VM, install oref0 there, create a profile (documented below), and run autotune on retrospective data from NS.



#### Phase A (Current): Running Autotune in “manual” mode on the command line

Autotune is currently being tested by a few users on the command line. There has been some additional work to make it easier to export to Excel for review.

How to run it:

Run `oref0-autotune <--dir=myopenaps_directory> <--ns-host=https://mynightscout.azurewebsites.net> [--start-date=YYYY-MM-DD] [--end-date=YYYY-MM-DD] [--runs=number_of_runs] [--xlsx=autotune.xlsx]`

If you're running this on a computer that doesn't have a myopenaps_directory, you can point it at a directory with a settings/pumpprofile.json file.  An example of a too-sensitive one would be:
```

        "endOffset": 1440
      }
    ],
    "first": 1
  },
  "carb_ratio": 1000
}
```
