# Testing during the day

You probably started looping for nighttime; but some people also choose to loop during the day. Here are some things to think about:

* Run the loop over 24 hours collectively in 3 days (doesn't have to be consecutive), and simply observe what the system does when you do meal boluses. You may want to go back to watching determine-basal to see understand what the loop is doing, and understanding `snoozeBG` and similar.

* Continue to observe the net basal insulin delivery after one week of looping. See what times of day the system is consistently leaving you with neg negative amounts of IOB to counteract or prevent low BGs; again, you may still be overbolusing and/or have basal rates set too high as a baseline.
