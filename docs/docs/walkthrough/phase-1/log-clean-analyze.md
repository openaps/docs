# Phase 1: Logging, Cleaning, and Analyzing Your Data

Phase 1 focuses on accessing, logging, cleaning up, and analyzing data from the pump and CGM. Data fidelity is extremely important, especially when dosing is being considered. Take the time to review what the openaps tools are outputting and carefully compare the logs against your own CareLink and CGM reports.

By the end of this phase, you should have Nightscout set up; have alerts configured to know whether your system is looping or not; and be analyzing your existing pump or CGM data.
