# Logging, Cleaning, and Analyzing Your Data

Phase 1 focuses on accessing, logging, cleaning up, and analyzing data from the pump and CGM. Data fidelity is extremely important, especially when dosing is being considered. Take the time to review what the openaps tools are outputting and carefully compare the logs against your own pump (CareLink) and CGM reports.

By the end of this phase, you will have your openaps workspace setup, which will allow you to learn how to use openaps tools to read data from your pump and your CGM device, and how to create and organize openaps reports and aliases. Furthermore, you will have Nightscout setup to visualize your pump and CGM data.
