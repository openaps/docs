# Offline monitoring

There are a number of ways to have an "offline" OpenAPS rig, and numerous ways to monitor offline.  Offline refers to situations where your rig moves into an area where it does not have internet access (i.e., the rig does not have a known wifi network available and the cell phone used with the rig does not have cell coverage/hotspot available).  By setting up one of these offline solutions, your rig can still loop while in an offline area.  Depending on the setup, the opportunities to visualize or monitor the loop actions (e.g., check what temp basal is actually being set) may vary until you can get back into an online area.

## Offline looping

### Medtronic CGM users
Medtronic CGM users can, by default, automatically loop offline because the rig will read CGM data directly from the pump.

### Dexcom CGM users
Dexcom CGM users have a few different alternatives to retrieve blood glucose values locally for offline use.  The options to choose from are:

1. For android users, you can use xDrip or xDrip+.  NOTE: All active development is being done on xDrip+. The details for setting up this configuration are described in the section below for xDrip offline.
   * xDrip: [http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/](http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/)
   * xDrip+: [https://jamorham.github.io/#xdrip-plus](https://jamorham.github.io/#xdrip-plus) 
   
2. For iPhone users, you can set up a modified Loop app to bring data in locally.  The directions for this configuration are provided in the section below for local, offline BGs using Loop app.  

3. **EASIEST:** For either Android or iPhone users, you can plug the CGM receiver directly into your rig via USB. This will pull BGs into the rig directly from the receiver and be used for looping.  If you are a G4 user, this will also bring RAW BG data into the rig during sensor restarts or ??? times.  The rig will loop using RAW BGs so long as the BG value is under 150 mg/dl.  A few notes about how to make the direct-receiver configuration work:

   * Explorer boards built prior to late January of 2017 are not always working well/automatically with a CGM receiver plugged in.  These boards can be identified by looking to see if they say "2016" on the board's label tag, as shown in the photo below.  The boards can be fixed to use a CGM receiver by making a single trace cut, but doing so will disable the board's the ability to re-flash your Edison. Please make sure you have a second Explorer board or another base block or breakout board that you can use to re-flash the Edison if needed before considering this modification. For more details, see [this issue](https://github.com/EnhancedRadioDevices/915MHzEdisonExplorer/issues/14), and if you decide to make the cut, see [this document for details on how to cut the copper trace from pin 61 of the 70 pin connector](https://github.com/EnhancedRadioDevices/915MHzEdisonExplorer/wiki#usb-otg-flakiness). Cut in two places and dig out the copper between. Cut by poking a razor point in. Avoid the narrow trace above the one being cut.
   
   * Explorer Boards that shipped at or after the end of February 2017/first week of March 2017 should enable users to simply plug in the CGM receiver to the OTG port, and a USB battery into the UART port, in order to run offline and pull BGs from the receiver. Those boards will have a label of v1.2 2017.
   
   ![Old explorer board version](../../Images/versions.jpg)

  * The order of the cables and ports is important.  The OTG cable must be plugged into the OTG port on the Explorer board.  There are two kinds of OTG cables; (1) both ends are micro-USB like the one you can [order here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TQOEST0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_Niqfzb3B4RJJW) or (2) one end is USB and one end is micro-USB like the one you can [order here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1099).  Both will work, but if you have the second kind, that cable must be the one plugged into the rig directly, and the other non-OTG cable must be plugged into the receiver (as shown in photo below).  That port is labeled on the underside of the port, it is the one closest to the lipo battery plug. A USB battery or wall charger must be plugged into the UART port to supply sufficient voltage to the ORG port (the lipo battery alone is not enough to power the OTG port). 
  
  ![OTG configurations](../../Images/otg.jpg)

* If you are using this configuration for G4 receivers and (1) are online and (2) want to see RAW BGs in NS, then you must remember to add `rawbg` to your ENABLE line in your Heroku/Azure settings.  You will also have to go to your Nightscout site's settings and select "always" from the Show RAW BG options.  You will also have to select `g4-raw` (if on master branch) or `g4-upload` (if on dev branch) as the CGM type in the loop setup script.

## Offline monitoring

* See Pancreabble instructions below for connecting your rig to your watch
* See xDrip/xDrip+ instructions below for seeing offline loop status
* See HotButton instructions below for setting temp targets and controlling your rig offline via an Android

### Note about recovery from Camping Mode/Offline mode for Medtronic CGM users:

If you have been running offline for a significant amount of time, and use a Medtronic CGM, you may need to run

```
openaps first-upload
```
from inside your openAPS directory, before your loop will start updating correctly to your nightscout site.

### Pancreabble

_(TO DO Note - Pancreabble instructions for OpenAPS need to be re-worked to reflect the oref0-setup script way of making it work. Below is notes about Pancreabble setup prior to oref0-setup.sh being in existence.)_

[Pancreabble] is a way to monitor your loop _locally_, by pairing a Pebble smartwatch directly with the Raspberry Pi or Intel Edison.

In other words, whereas the default setup looks like this:

```
Raspberry Pi/Intel Edison -> network -> Nightscout server -> network -> smartphone
                                                                     |
                                                                     -> laptop
                                                                     |
                                                                     -> Pebble watch
```

And by default, your Pebble is paired thus:

```
               smartphone -> Bluetooth -> Pebble watch
```

With Pancreabble, the setup looks like this:

```
Raspberry Pi/Intel Edison -> Bluetooth -> Pebble watch
```

Using a Pebble watch can be especially helpful during the "open loop" phase: you can send the loop's recommendations directly to your wrist, making it easy to evaluate the decisions it would make in different contexts during the day (before/after eating, when active, etc.).

See [Pancreabble] for initial setup instructions.

[Pancreabble]: https://github.com/mddub/pancreabble

Once you've done the first stages above, you'll need to do generate a status file that can be passed over to the Pebble Urchin watch face. Fortunately, the core of this is available in oref0.

Go to `~src/oref0/bin` and look for `peb-urchin-status.sh`. This gives you the basic framework to generate output files that can be used with Pancreabble. To use it, you'll need to install jq using:

`apt-get install jq`

If you get errors, you may need to run `apt-get update` ahead of attempting to install jq.

Once jq is installed, the shell script runs and produces the `urchin-status.json` file which is needed to update the status on the pebble. It can be incorporated into an alias that regularly updates the pebble. You can modify it to produce messages that you want to see there.

When installing the oref0-setup you will need to replace all instances of AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF with the Pebble MAC address. This can be found in Settings/System/Information/BT Address.  NOTE: Make sure the MAC address is in ALL CAPS.

Once you've installed, you will need to pair the watch to your Edison.

#### Bluetooth setup for Pancreabble

* Restart the Bluetooth daemon to start up the bluetooth services.  (This is normally done automatically by oref0-online once everything is set up, but we want to do things manually this first time):

`sudo killall bluetoothd`

* Wait a few seconds, and run it again, until you get `bluetoothd: no process found` returned.  Then start it back up again:

`sudo /usr/local/bin/bluetoothd --experimental &`

* Wait at least 10 seconds, and then run:

`sudo hciconfig hci0 name $HOSTNAME`

* If you get a `Can't change local name on hci0: Network is down (100)` error, start over with `killall` and wait longer between steps.

* Now launch the Bluetooth control program: `bluetoothctl`

* And run: `power off`

* then `power on`

* and each of the following:

```
discoverable on

scan on

agent on

default-agent
```

#### On Your Pebble

Settings/BLUETOOTH to make sure Pebble is in pairing mode

from terminal 

`trust AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`
`pair AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`

you might need to do this several times before it pairs

you will see on the edison

`Request confirmation
[agent] Confirm passkey 123456 (yes/no): yes`

* (WARNING: You must type in **yes** not just **y** to pair)

Once paired, type quit to exit.


Currently the `peb-urchin-status.sh` has 1 notification and 3 different options for urchin messages.
in you APS directory there is a file called 'pancreoptions.json' 
```
"urchin_loop_on": true,  <--- to turn on or off urchin watchface update
"urchin_loop_status": false, <--- Gives a message on urchin watchface that it's running
"urchin_iob": true,   <--- Gives a message on urchin watchface of current IOB
"urchin_temp_rate": false, <--- Gives a message on urchin watchface of current temp basal
"notify_temp_basal": false <--- Notificaiton of temp basal when one shows up in enact/suggested.json
```
note only one of the messages for the urchin watchface can be true at once

the `peb-urchin-status.sh` gets called from the crontab and will run automatically.
By default the urchin_loop_on, and urchin_iob is set to true. You must manually change notify_temp_basal to true to start getting temp basal notifications. 
you can edit this file using `nano pancreoptions.json` from your APS directory.

### xDripAPS for offline BGs for Android users

**Note as of 1/26/17:** The below documentation is WIP and needs additional testing.

Do you use OpenAPS and the xDrip/xDrip+ Android App? Until now this required an internet connection to upload your xDrip/xDrip+ Android App CGM data to an online Nightscout instance (the OpenAPS community recommends utilizing Heroku). Then your data was downloaded to your OpenAPS rig for use in your online loop. The xDripAPS code resides on your OpenAPS rig and allows the direct transfer of xDrip/xDrip+ Android App CGM data to your OpenAPS rig without an internet connection. xDripAPS creates an offline OpenAPS rig which utilizes a "local" or "personal" network (WiFi hotspot or Bluetooth PAN tethering) for direct communication between the xDrip/xDrip+ Android device and the OpenAPS rig. Data which is 'missing' from Nightscout will be uploaded when the OpenAPS rig regains internet connectivity.

The OpenAPS community recommends an Explorer Board / Intel Edison rig, but xDripAPS also works with a Raspberry Pi rig.

Configuring an offline OpenAPS rig is quite easy because the OpenAPS setup script (oref0-setup.sh v0.4.0 and later) supports an automated installation of xDripAPS and dependencies. When running the OpenAPS setup script you simply specify "xdrip" (without the quotes) when promped to specify a CGM type (e.g. MDT, G4). Alternatively, manual installation instructions can be found at the bottom of this page.

#### Overview of xDripAPS
With xDripAPS, the flow of data is as follows -

(1) CGM transmitter --> (2) xDrip/xDrip+ Android app --> (3) OpenAPS rig (e.g. Edison) --> (4) Nightscout

1. Usually a Dexcom G5, or G4 plus xDrip wireless bridge.
2. Either xDrip or xDrip+ can be used. In the app, the REST API Upload feature is normally used to upload CGM data to Nightscout. Instead, we use this feature to upload to xDripAPS on your OpenAPS rig (further details below).
3. Your OpenAPS rig - usually a Raspberry Pi or an Intel Edison.
4. The xDrip or xDrip+ app is now uploading your data to xDripAPS on your OpenAPS rig rather than to Nightscout. OpenAPS will now upload your CGM data to Nightscout as well as treatments, pump status, etc. So your Nightscout site will still be updated. Note that it will take a couple of minutes longer for CGM data to reach Nightscout, compared with when uploading directly from xDrip or xDrip+

#### Setup Steps (using oref0-setup.sh script)

##### Setting up your OpenAPS rig
Install OpenAPS as per the documentation. While running the oref0-setup script you will be prompted to specify a CGM source. Enter "xdrip" (without the quotes). The setup script takes care of the rest! Follow the remainder of the setup script as normal.

##### Connect your Android phone and your OpenAPS rig
For the xDrip/xDrip+ app on your Android phone to be able to send CGM data to xDripAPS on your OpenAPS rig, they both need to be connected to the same "personal" network. Note that an internet connection is not required - this solution allows you to loop without internet connectivity.

There are two approaches for establishing a "personal" network between your phone and your OpenAPS rig. The first is to run a WiFi hotspot on your phone and connect your OpenAPS rig to the WiFi network your phone exposes. This is the easiest option, but there are two drawbacks - it drains your phone battery quickly, and some phones cannot connect to a normal WiFi network while the WiFi hotspot is enabled (it can connect to the internet via 3G/4G when coverage is available).

The other option is to enable bluetooth PAN tethering on your phone and have your OpenAPS rig connect to it. This does not drain the phone's battery as quickly and means that the phone can still connect to a normal WiFi network for internet access when available (and to 3G/4G networks when WiFi is not available). I use this approach 24/7 - my OpenAPS rig is permanently tethered to my Nexus 6P phone. I can get a full day of phone usage without running out of battery, unless I make a lot of calls or have a lot of screen-on time.

Instructions on both approaches can be found in the main OpenAPS documentation.

##### Configuring the xDrip/xDrip+ Android app
First, determine your OpenAPS rig's IP address within your "personal" network. If you can open a terminal session to your rig via serial, then `ifconfig wlan0` (when using the WiFi hostpost option) or `ifconfig bnep0` (when using bluetooth tethering) will display your IP address. Alternatively, you can use an Android app - there are lots of "Network IP Scanner" apps in the Play store. The Hurricane Electric Network Tools app works with both the WiFi hotspot and BT tethering options.

Next, open xDrip or xDrip+ and navigate to Settings > Cloud Upload > API Upload (REST). In the `Base URL` setting, configure the following URL

`http://<nightscout_api_secret>@<rig_ip_address>:5000/api/v1/`

A few notes to clarify:
   * enter "http://" NOT "https://
   * <nightscout_api_secret> is the plain-text API secret used when creating your online Nightscout instance.
   * <rig_ip_address> is the IP address of your OpenAPS rig assigned by your WiFi, WiFi hotspot, or Bluetooth PAN tether connection. It will usually take the form of: `192.168.xxx.xxx`.

![REST API Upload setting](https://github.com/colinlennon/xDripAPS/blob/master/xDrip_REST_API_cropped.png "REST API Upload setting")

If using xDrip+ navigate to Settings > Cloud Upload > MongoDB and uncheck the "Skip LAN uploads" option. Do not turn on the "Enable Nightscout Mongo DB sync" option. Next, navigate to Settings > Cloud Upload > API Upload (REST) and uncheck the "Skip LAN uploads" option. NOTE: if you don't have these options, update to a recent version of the xDrip+ app. These options were added to a nightly build in December 2016.

##### Advanced Options

* Use both API Upload (REST) and MongoDB
    * You can use both the API Upload (REST) and the MongoDB upload options.  This has the advantage of immediately showing your BG values in Nightscout and allows OpenAPS to continue to get BG values if the link ever fails between your xDrip/xDrip+ uploader phone and your rig.  One disadvantage to this method is that you will have duplicate entries in your Mongo database.
* Enter multiple REST URLs
    * If you are needing to constantly switch between two or more "personal" networks, you would have to edit the `Base URL` each time with the new IP address. To simplify this process, multiple URLs can be added to the REST API Upload `Base URL` setting, and xDrip/xDrip+ will attempt to upload to each URL.  NOTE:  the URLs must be "space" deliminated.  For example:
```
http://<nightscout_api_secret>@<rig_ip_address1>:5000/api/v1/ http://<nightscout_api_secret>@<rig_ip_address2>:5000/api/v1/
```

#### Manual installation steps

##### N.B. It is recommended that you use the oref0-setup script as described above, rather than installing manually.

1. Install SQLite3 -

  a. Raspbian -
    ```
    apt-get install sqlite3
    ```

  b. Yocto -
    ```
    cd ~
    wget https://sqlite.org/2016/sqlite-tools-linux-x86-3150200.zip
    unzip sqlite-tools-linux-x86-3150200.zip
    mv sqlite-tools-linux-x86-3150200 sqlite
    ```

2. Get dependencies -
  ```
  pip install flask
  pip install flask-restful
  ```

3. Clone this repo -
  ```
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/colinlennon/xDripAPS.git .xDripAPS
  ```

4. Create directory for database file -
  ```
  mkdir -p ~/.xDripAPS_data
  ```

5. Add cron entry to start the microservice at startup -
  e.g. -
  `@reboot         python /home/root/.xDripAPS/xDripAPS.py`

6. Cofigure the xDrip Android app -
  `xDrip > Settings > REST API Upload > Set Enabled and enter Base URL: http://[API_SECRET]@[Pi/Edison_IP_address]:5000/api/v1/`
 
  (Note: Enter your plain-text API_SECRET in the Android app, not the hashed version of it).


7. Use the microservice within OpenAPS
  e.g.
  ```
  openaps device add xdrip process 'bash -c "curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/v1/entries?count=288"'
  openaps report add monitor/glucose.json text xdrip shell
  ```

### Hot Button - also for Android users

#### Purpose
[Hot Button app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=crosien.HotButton) can be used to monitor and control OpenAPS using SSH commands. It is especialy useful for offline setups. Internet connection is not required, it is enough to have the rig connected to your android smartphone using bluetooth tethering.

#### App Setup 
To setup the button you need to long click. Setup the Server Settings and set them as default. For every other button you can load them.

#### Basic commands
To the Command part of the button setup you can write any command which you would run in the ssh session. For example to show the automatic sensitivity ratio, you can set:
`cat /root/myopenaps/settings/autosens.json`

After button click the command is executed and the results are displayed in the black text area bellow the buttons. 

#### Temporary targets
It is possible to use Hot Button application for setup of temporary targets.  This [script](https://github.com/lukas-ondriga/openaps-share/blob/master/start-temp-target.sh) generates the custom temporary target starting at the time of its execution. You need to edit the path to the openaps folder inside it.

To setup activity mode run:
`./set_temp_target.sh "Activity Mode" 130`

To setup eating soon mode run:
`./set_temp_target.sh "Eating Soon" 80`

The script is currently work in progress. The first parameter is probably not needed, it is there to have the same output as Nightscout produces. It is not possible to set different top and bottom target, but this could be easily added in the future. 
To be able to use the script, the most straigtforward solution is to disable the download of temporary targets from Nightscout. To do that edit your openaps.ini and remove `openaps ns-temptargets` from ns-loop. 

#### SSH Login Speedup
To speed up the command execution you can add to the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` the following line:
`UseDNS no`

### Local, offline BGs for iPhone users using a separate Loop app

These instructions describe how to use a Loopkit/Loop app as a glucose data source for offline looping using OpenAPS. Note that most of the features of Loop itself are not used in this modification; we are using Loop simply as a local bridge for glucose data from the G5 transmitter to the OpenAPS rig. If you have a working version of Loop already installed, it is recommended build this branch as a separate app by using a unique bundle identifier.

Also, for those unfamiliar with Loop, note the below instructions are about creating a developer account to self-deploy the app. This is free, but you'd have to re-build the app every 7 days (and it will probably drive you crazy). Otherwise, it's $99 for a developer licenese where you don't have to re-deploy weekly. (For other alternatives for offline BG, see the top of this page).

#### Prerequisites for using Loop app on iPhone for local, offline BGs to the rig
1. Build (and deploy to your iPhone) a version of Loop using the `lookout` branch from @thebookins. Follow the instructions in [Loop Docs](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/) but install Loop as follows:
```
git clone https://github.com/thebookins/Loop.git
cd Loop
git checkout lookout
```
(alternatively, merge the `lookout` changes with your own Loop fork). Depending on the version of XCode you are using, it may be necessary to rebuild the linked frameworks using carthage:
```
carthage update --platform iOS
```

2. If you haven't already done so, install the dev branch of OpenAPS using the [setup script](https://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/walkthrough/phase-2/oref0-setup.html) with `xdrip` as the glucose source.

3. Step 2 will set up [xDripAPS](https://github.com/colinlennon/xDripAPS) on your OpenAPS rig. This is a Python program that exposes a very simplified NightScout instance running on the rig to which we can send glucose data. A couple of changes to xDripAPS are required to get it to accept glucose data from Loop. Pull these changes as follows:
```
cd
rm -r .xDripAPS
git clone https://github.com/thebookins/xDripAPS.git $HOME/.xDripAPS
cd .xDripAPS
git checkout lookout
```

4. Setup up [Bluetooth tethering](http://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/walkthrough/phase-4/bluetooth-tethering-edison.html) between your iPhone and your OpenAPS rig.

5. Open Loop and the Dexcom app on your iPhone. The Dexcom app will control the G5 transmitter; Loop just listens in.

#### Setup
1. In Loop, select G5 Transmitter in Settings and enter the G5 Transmitter ID. Do not add the pump serial number as we are using Loop only as a local bridge to get BG data to OpenAPS. (Without a RileyLink, it's impossible to control the pump anyway.)

2. In Loop, select Nightscout in Settings and enter the local IP address for your Edison in URL format with the addition of `:5000` at the end (which will look like this `http://[YOUR EDISON'S IP ADDRESS]:5000`). Then, enter your API secret as requested in Loop.

All done. Loop will now send glucose data to the edison URL every five minutes, ready to be picked up by oref0.

********************************

### Creating an information web page that can be picked up using the rig's URL.

**TODO** - implement this as a proper oref0 script that can be installed by oref0-setup

This allows you to extract data from the various files that OpenAPS creates and access the locally from the phone that is connected to the rig, giving a full information set.

Firstly, you need to set up the script that will do this for you. An example is shown below:

```
rm ~/myopenaps/enact/index.html
touch ~/myopenaps/enact/index.html

(cat ~/myopenaps/enact/smb-enacted.json | jq -r .timestamp | awk '{print substr($0,12,5)}') >> ~/myopenaps/enact/index.html

(cat ~/myopenaps/enact/smb-enacted.json | jq -r .reason) >> ~/myopenaps/enact/index.html
(echo -n 'TBR: ' && cat ~/myopenaps/enact/smb-enacted.json | jq .rate) >> ~/myopenaps/enact/index.html                                  
(echo -n 'IOB: ' && cat ~/myopenaps/enact/smb-enacted.json | jq .IOB) >> ~/myopenaps/enact/index.html
(echo -n 'Edison Battery: ' && cat ~/myopenaps/monitor/edison-battery.json | jq -r .battery | tr '\n' ' ' && echo '%') >> ~/myopenaps/enact/index.html
(echo -n 'Insulin Remaining: ' && cat ~/myopenaps/monitor/reservoir.json) >> ~/myopenaps/enact/index.html
```
You may need to adjust the values in `'{print substr($0,12,5)}'` - whilst I know these work on the rigs I have set them up on, other's have had better results with `{print substr($0,13,5)}'`

It can be set up where you choose, either in your openaps directory or at root.

You will also need to start up the SimpleHTTPserver service that is already installed on jubilinux in the location you will place your file. This is done by adding the following line to your Cron:

```
@reboot cd /root/myopenaps/enact && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337
```
The final thing to do is to make sure the script runs regularly to collect the data and publish it. This requires an additional cron line:

```
*/5 * * * * (bash /root/http.sh) 2>&1 | tee -a /var/log/openaps/http.log
```
In this case the script is running from the /root directory and I am publishing to the ~/myopenaps/enact directory.

To access this from an iphone browser, enter something like the following: http://172.20.10.x:1337/index.html and you should receive an unformatted html page with the data in it. If you want to improve the output for a browser, the script can be modified to generate html tags that will allow formatting and could provide colouring if various predicted numbers were looking too low.

On Android, you can download http-widget (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.rosoftlab.httpwidget1&hl=en_GB) and add a widget to your home screen that will display this data.

If you use a Samsung Gear S3 watch, you can use the above http-widget with Wearable Widgets (http://wearablewidgets.com) to view what OpenAPS is doing locally, without internet connection.
