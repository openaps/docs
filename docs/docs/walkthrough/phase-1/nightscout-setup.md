# Visualization and Monitoring

## Nightscout Introduction

[Nightscout](http://nightscout.info) is an open source, DIY project that allows real-time access to a CGM data
via personal website, smartwatch viewers, or apps and widgets available for
smartphones. Setting up a Nightscout web app is the recommended way to visualize your
OpenAPS closed loop.

Nightscout allows a user to upload CGM data from a variety of sources, to an
online database and cloud computing service. The information is then processed
and displayed visually as a graph. There are plugins that allow greater
information to be shown about OpenAPS, too. As the data is uploaded to an online
website and then retrieved by OpenAPS, it allows OpenAPS a wider range of
compatibility with various CGM solutions.

**[Nightscout](http://nightscout.info) is the recommended way to visualize your
OpenAPS closed loop.** 

Even if you don't choose to share your Nightscout site
with another person, it will be helpful for you to visualize what the loop is
doing; what it's been doing; plus generate helpful reports for understanding
your data, customized watchfaces with your OpenAPS data, and integration with IFTTT.  You can read more about the latest Nightscout features [here](http://www.nightscout.info/wiki/welcome/website-features/0-9-features).

## Nightscout Setup

* If you plan to use Nightscout with OpenAPS, we recommend using Heroku, as OpenAPS can reach the usage limits of the free Azure plan and cause it to shut down for hours or days. If you end up needing a paid tier, the $7/mo Heroku plan is also much cheaper than the first paid tier of Azure.  Currently, the only added benefit to choosing the $7/mo Heroku plan vs the free Heroku plan is a section showing site use metrics for performance (such as response time).  This has limited benefit to the average OpenAPS user.  **In short, Heroku is the free and OpenAPS-friendly option for NS hosting.**

* Create an account at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and choose the Primary Development Language to be Node.js when you create your account.  You’re going to use a free account, but you will still need to enter credit card information for your account setup before the app will deploy.  You'll need confirm your Heroku account by clicking a link sent via email.

![Heroku signup example](../phase-1/img/heroku_signup.jpg)

* Create an account at [GitHub](https://github.com)
*****************
**Note:** If you already have an existing GitHub account and NS site, you may just need to update your repository by doing a Compare in GitHub.  Use `https://github.com/yourgithubname/cgm-remote-monitor/compare/master...nightscout:master` and replace yourgithub name.  Click the big green `Create pull request` button. Another screen will appear, fill in a title and click button to `create the pull request`, and then you can `Merge pull request`, and finally `Confirm merge`.  That process updates your Nightscout repository in Github.  Once updated, you can skip the "click the Fork Button" step below and start following along with the purple `Deploy to Heroku` button step from your updated Nightscout cgm-remote-monitor repository.
*****************
* Go to the [Nightscout cgm-remote-monitor repository](https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor)

* Click the `Fork` button in the upper right corner

![Fork example](../phase-1/img/ns_fork.jpg)

* Scroll down until you see the purple `Deploy to Heroku` button.  Click that button.

![Deploy to heroku button](../phase-1/img/deploy_heroku.jpg)

* Give your app a name, this will be the prefix of your NS site’s URL. For example, `https://yourappname.herokuapp.com`

* Fill out the information lines in the `Config Variables` Section of that page, as shown below.  Some of the lines can stay with the default entries already provided.

</tbody>
</table>

**The remaining variables can be left at their default values.**</br></br>

*****************
**Note:** for BRIDGE_MAX_COUNT: This value sets the number of BG values to pull from Share per update.  Each Dexcom BG value represent 5 minutes.  Nightscount defaults to BRIDGE_MAX_COUNT=1.  If you lose connectivity with your Dexcom transmitter, your Share app will automatically backfill data points when you regain connectivity.  Nightscount does not do this and you will have gaps in the data for when you were out of range.  More information here https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor#bridge-share2nightscout-bridge  

You can change the BRIDGE_MAX_COUNT value to pull more samples per query, which will backfill BRIDGE_MAX_COUNT values for you.  This change increases your data usage and may affect your Nightscout billing tier.   Setting BRIDGE_MAX_COUNT to 7 will update the previous 35 minutes of data and will keep OpenAPS up to date on your current BG trends.  If you frequently have larger data gaps and you use autotune, you may consider increasing this number more to backfill data more aggressively.
*****************

* Click the purple `Deploy` button at the bottom of screen.

![Deploy](../phase-1/img/deploy_button.jpg)

* Wait a little bit while Heroku builds your NS app.  You’ll see some text scroll by in the Build App box, and then finally, you will have a message that the NS app was successfully deployed.  If the app fails to deploy, it may be that you have not added your credit card information to your account yet.  Go add that information in your account billing section, and then come back and press the deploy button again.  Don't worry, your account is still free unless you choose otherwise.  The credit card simply gives you added dyno hours on your free account (win-win).

![Successful deploy](../phase-1/img/deploy_success.jpg)

* You can verify your site’s successful build by clicking `View` (you should see black site with a profile warning).  You will be redirected to a profile set-up page.  (If it doesn't redirect automatically, refresh your webpage).  

![No profile](../phase-1/img/no_profile.jpg)

You do not have to enter all the information in the profile if you are using OpenAPS (since OpenAPS will be providing the information for IOB and COB rather than letting NS calculate them), but you do have to fill out the `Basal Profile` and `TimeZone` at a minimum in order to have your temp basals properly display.  Click `Save` when you have entered the information.  You will be prompted to authenticate, if it is the first time you’ve used the device to make changes in your profile.  Click on the `Authenticate` link at the bottom of the site, and enter your API_SECRET to complete the authentication.

**Note:**  OpenAPS will only work based on the values in your pump; not the values that you put into Nightscout profile. You will need to keep the Nightscout basal profile in-sync with any changes you make in your pump to prevent later confusion in watching the temp basal rendering.

![Profile for basals](../phase-1/img/profile.jpg)

* Assuming your previous browser tab is still open for "Create a new App | Heroku", let's go back to that tab.  This time instead of choosing the `View` option, we are going to select the `Manage App` button. Then, select the `Settings` tab near the top of the screen on your Heroku app.

![Heroku settings](../phase-1/img/settings_heroku.jpg)

* Click on `Reveal Config  Vars`. Scroll down the bottom of the Config Vars lines until you find the last blank one.  You are going to add several additional lines of config vars for OpenAPS use; the DEVICESTATUS_ADVANCED is a required line, the others just make Nightscout more useful when using OpenAPS.

If you are using the Nightscout Bridge to bring in CGM data from Dexcom servers (G4 Share2 app or G5 Mobile app) and are outside the US, you will need to add a setting for `BRIDGE_SERVER` and set the value to `EU`.

* Click on `Open App` in the top right corner of your Heroku site.

![Open app](../phase-1/img/open_app.jpg)


* Click on the settings (those three horizontal lines in upper right corner).  Now check that your basal render is selected to either default or icicle (personal preference for how the temp basals show as blue lines in NS site), check the boxes that you’d like display pills in the SHOW PLUGINS (usually all of them), and then press save. Your NIGHTSCOUT site is all set-up.  Congrats!

### It's not working - I'm missing data in Nightscout? 

If you are using a "test pump" that has not received sufficient data in some time, Nightscout pills will NOT be displayed onscreen. Nightscout may also not work if it hasn't had CGM data in a while - so if you haven't been using a CGM and uploading CGM data to Nightscout for the past few days, the site may be empty as well.  If this happens, simply use this pump in tandem with a CGM so glucose values are recorded and eventually uploaded to Nightscout.  Once sufficient data has been collected, (and OpenAPS plugin is enabled and saved), the OpenAPS pills should appear automatically. Medtronic CGM users may also [need to do this to get their CGM data flowing into Nightscout after a gap in uploading data](http://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/dev/docs/walkthrough/phase-1/offline-looping-and-monitoring.html#note-about-recovery-from-camping-mode-offline-mode-for-medtronic-cgm-users).

### Switching from Azure to Heroku

* If you are a current OpenAPS user and want to switch from Azure to Heroku, you will need to change your NS URL in both `ns.ini` and in `cron`.  Alternatively, you can edit your runagain.sh file and run the setup script again. 

* If you’d like to seamlessly keep all your old Azure NS data showing in your new Heroku NS site, you’ll need to copy and paste your old `MONGODB` string from your Azure site. Find it in either Application Settings or Connection strings in your Azure control panel and then go to Heroku’s `MONGODB_URI` line. Replace the content with your copied string from Azure. Double check that your Azure collection used the “entries” name…if it doesn’t, then you will need to update that variable in Heroku to match as well.

**Note:** It's a good idea to to check your deployment connection in Heroku's dashboard after your deploy (typically this still needs to be manually connected after initial setup).  Go your `Deploy` tab in your Heroku dashboard, click on the GitHub service, and select your GitHub cgm-remote-monitor repository.  You can select the cgm-remote-monitor branch you'd like to deploy at the bottom of the screen.  Both master and dev branches work for OpenAPS.

![Deploy branch](../phase-1/img/deploy_branch.jpg)


### A Note about Nightscout's COB Pill

If you have the Advanced Meal Assist (AMA) OpenAPS feature turned on, OpenAPS calculates COB *dynamically*. To see your COB on your Nightscout web app, look inside the OpenAPS pill. _(If it says "undefined", this means you do NOT have AMA turned on.)_

Nightscout, however, has its own COB pill, which decays carbs *statically*, and it is **NOT** used in OpenAPS calculations.

* **We highly recommend NOT using the Nightscout COB pill.** We even recommend removing it from your Nightscout ENABLE web app settings as it causes bugs, and great confusion, because it will do a static decay and/or mess up your Nightscout. 

* **Note also**: Nightscout's Bolus Wizard Preview (BWP) pill also decays carbs *statically*. 

* **To avoid confusion: Turn off all other Nightscout pills that use *static* COB calculations.**

### How to display basal changes ("render basal")

* In case you missed it during setup: we recommend that you "render"/display the basal rates (the blue lines to show what temp basals have been enacted, if any.) To do so, select "Default" or "Icicle" from the "Render Basal" pull-down menu in the Settings.

### How to display OpenAPS purple prediction/forecast lines

* Click the three dots next to your timeframe horizon (3HR, 6HR, 12HR, 24HR) and then enable “Show OpenAPS Forecasts”. Don't see this option? Check and make sure you added this variable and that your OpenAPS has successfully run.

### Understanding the OpenAPS pill

The OpenAPS pill box has four states, based on what happened in the last 15
minutes: Enacted, Looping, Waiting, and Warning:

* Waiting is when OpenAPS is uploading, but hasn't seen the pump in a while
* Warning is when there hasn't been a status upload in the last 15 minutes
* Enacted means OpenAPS has recently enacted the pump
* Looping means OpenAPS is running but has not enacted the pump
* Unknown means Error or Timeout; OpenAPS has reported a failure, or has reported no status for many hours.

### All of a sudden, Nightscout is no longer showing treatments (bolus, carbs, finger BGs) on the graph or rendering my basals.

If you suddenly find that Nightscout is not showing treatments (bolus, carbs, finger BGs etc.) on the graph; and/or that your basals are no longer being rendered in the blue basal line; but otherwise, everything looks normal and you are looping properly:

You probably somehow got a future-dated treatment. One possible reason is a clock-time mismatch between your devices - for example, your BG meter, pump, CGM, or OpenAPS rig may have different dates or times set.

**To remove future treatments:**
* Go into Nightscout under "Settings" and "Admin tools" and delete any future-dated treatments (press the "remove treatments in the future" button). If the future treatments were caused by a time mismatch, you'll need to resolve that first, or the future dated treatments may simply be re-uploaded.
