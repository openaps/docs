# Troubleshooting oref0-setup script process

## Re-run the script again

You won't hurt anything by running the script (step 2) multiple times, as long as you name it something different. If you already have a working loop and are testing the setup scripts, just make sure to comment out in cron the loop you don't want running.

## Should I enact cron?

Cron is the scheduler that runs the loop. I.e. this is the automation feature to automate your closed loop. If you're using a test pump, it's pretty safe to go ahead and automate your loop. But if you're not sure, you can always come back and do this later.

## How do I know if it is working?

* Check your pump to see if it is setting temp basals.
* "Tail" the pump log to see what is is doing: `tail -F /var/log/openaps/pump-loop.log`
* Check Nightscout to see if it is updating with your information
* Run commands manually (check out the [openaps toolkit basics here](http://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/openaps-guide/core/medtronic.html#openaps-use-pump)) 

## It's not working yet:

* Check to make sure that your pump is in absolute and not % mode for temp basals.
* Did you put in the right SN for the pump? Should be numbers only...
* Check to make sure your carelink and/or radio stick is plugged in.
* Check to make sure your receiver is plugged in, if you're plugging a receiver in.
* Don't have data in Nightscout? Make sure there is no trailing slash `/` on the URL that you are entering and that the API secret is correct.
* Check and make sure your receiver is >50% charged (if battery low, it may drain the Pi and prevent it from operating).
* Check and make sure your pump is in range of the radio stick.
* Check and make sure your pump is not suspended or stuck in rewind or prime screens. If it's a test pump, you don't even have to fill a reservoir, but put your pinky finger or eraser-end of a pencil in for slight pressure when priming so the pump will "sense" it and stop. Make sure to back out of the prime screen.
