# Phase 2: Creating a Predictive Low Glucose Management (PLGM) loop

Phase 2 focuses on using the oref0-setup.sh script to create a basic loop that can make the necessary changes to basal rates to help prevent low blood glucose events, but that will not dose additional insulin beyond normally scheduled basal if BG is too high.

Note: oref0 (short for "OpenAPS Reference Design 0") is our first (zero-th) implementation of the OpenAPS Reference Design. It consists of a number of "Lego block" tools that, when combined with the core openaps toolset, create a full closed loop artificial pancreas system â€” an OpenAPS implementation.
