# Troubleshooting overview

Even those who follow this documentation precisely are bound to end up stuck at some point. This could be due to something unique to your system, a mistyped command, actions performed out of order, or even a typo in this guide. This section provides some tools to help diagnose the issue as well as some common errors that have been experienced and resolved before. If you get stuck, try re-reading the documentation again and after that, share what you've been working on, attempted steps to resolve, and other pertinent details in [#intend-to-bolus in Gitter](https://gitter.im/nightscout/intend-to-bolus) when asking for help troubleshooting. Here is also a [good blog post to read with tips on how to best seek help online to troubleshoot](https://diyps.org/2017/03/19/tips-for-troubleshooting-diy-diabetes-devices-openaps-or-otherwise/).

## Introduction to using Linux

Some familiarity with using the Terminal app (Mac computers) or Putty (Windows computers) will go a long way, but is not required for getting started.  Terminal (or PuTTY) is basically a portal into your rig, allowing us to use our computer's display and keyboard to communicate with the little [Edison or Pi] computer in your rig.  The active terminal line will show your current location, within the computer's file structure, where commands will be executed.  The line will end with a <tt>$</tt> and then have a prompt for you to enter your command.  

There are many commands that are useful, but some of the commands you'll get comfortable with are: 

* `cd` means "change directory" - you can `cd <directorynamewithnobrackets>` to change into a directory; and `cd ..` will take you backward one directory and `cd` will take you back to the root directory. If you try to `cd` into a file, your computer will tell you that's not going to happen.

* `ls` means "list", is also your friend - it will tell you what is inside a directory. If you don't see what you expect, you likely want to `cd ..` to back up a level until you can orient yourself. If you aren't comfortable with what `cd` and `ls` do or how to use them, take a look at some of the reference links on the [Technical Resources](<../Resources/technical-resources>) page. 

* `cat` means "concatenation" - it will show you the contents of a file if you `cat <filename>`.  Very useful when trying to see what you have in preferences or other oref0 files.

* `vi` and `nano` are both text editors.  Using those will bring you into files for the purposes of editing their contents.  It is like `cat` except you will be able to edit.
  * Within `vi` editor, you will need to enter the letter `i` to begin INSERT mode (and a little INSERT word will be shown at the bottom of the screen once you do that).  While in INSERT mode, you will be able to make edits.  To exit INSERT mode, you will press `esc`.  To save your changes and quit, you need to exit INSERT mode and then type `:wq`.
  * Within `nano` editor, you are automatically in editing mode.  You can make your edits and then to exit and save, you'll use `control-x`, `y` (to save the edits), and then `return` to save the edits to the same filename you started with.

* Up and Down arrow keys can scroll you back/forward through the previous commands you've entered in the terminal session.  Very useful if you don't want to memorize some of the longer commands.

* `Control-r` will let you search for previous commands.

One other helpful thing to do before starting any software work is to log your terminal session. This will allow you to go back and see what you did at a later date. This will also be immensely helpful if you request help from other OpenAPS contributors as you will be able to provide an entire history of the commands you used. To enable this, just run `script <filename>` at the beginning of your session. It will inform you that `Script started, file is <filename>`. When you are done, simply `exit` and it will announce `Script done, file is <filename>`. At that point, you can review the file as necessary.

## Directories on your rig

`ls <myopenaps>` will show the following files and subdirectories contained within the directory:
* autotune
* cgm
* cgm.ini
* detect-sensitivity.ini
* determine-basal.ini
* enact
* get-profile.ini
* iob.ini
* meal.ini
* mmtune_old.json
* monitor
* ns-glucose.ini
* ns.ini
* openaps.ini
* oref0.ini
* oref0-runagain.sh
* pebble.ini
* preferences.json
* pump.ini
* pump-session.json
* raw-cgm
* settings
* tz.ini
* units.ini
* upload
* xdrip.ini

`ls settings` will show the contents of the `settings` subdirectory; the files which collect longer-term loop data.  
* autosens.json

* pumphistory-24h.json
* pumphistory-24h-zoned.json
* pumpprofile.json
* settings.json

`ls monitor` will show the contents of the `monitor` subdirectory; current data going on right now in your loop.
* battery.json
* carbhistory.json
* clock.json
* clock-zoned.json
* edison-battery.json
* glucose.json

## Generally useful linux commands

More comprehensive command line references can be found [here](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2598082/linux/linux-linux-command-line-cheat-sheet.html) and [here](http://www.pixelbeat.org/cmdline.html). For the below, since these are basic linux things, also try using a basic search engine (e.g. Google) to learn more about them and their intended use.

`ls -alt` (List all of the files in the current directory with additional details.)

`cd` (Change directory)

`pwd` (Show the present working directory (your current location within the filesystem).)

`sudo <command>` (Super-user do. Temporarily elevates the current users permission to that of root.)

`apt-get install <package>` (Aptitude is a package manager, when a package is missing it will (usually) be there and can be installed by issuing 'apt-get install <missing package name>.)

`tail -f /var/log/syslog`

`grep LOOP /var/log/syslog` (Display lines in file that contain a string, in this example, 'LOOP')

`df -h` (shows available memory on your rig)

`ifconfig`

`cat <filename>` (Display the contents of the file.)

`nano <filename>` (Open and edit the file in the nano text editor.)

`stat <filename>`

`head <filename>` (Display the beginning of the file.)

`less <filename>` (Display the contents of the file, with advanced navigation)

`pip freeze`

`sudo reboot` (Reboot the system)

`sudo shutdown -h now` (The correct way to shut down the Raspberry Pi from the command line. Wait for the green light to stop blinking before removing the power supply.)

`dmesg` (Displays all the kernel output since boot. Itâ€™s pretty difficult to read, but sometimes you see things in there about the wifi getting disconnected and so forth.)

`uptime` (Shows how long the system has been running and the load average of last minute/5 minutes/15 minutes)

`crontab -l` (Display cron jobs)

`sudo service cron status` (Display info on cron service. Also use `stop` and `start`)
