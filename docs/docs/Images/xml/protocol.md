# Protocol for uploading flowchart images

We recommend using draw.io, a free open source tool for image/flowchart/diagram creation and editing. This tool allows you to use it via desktop or web interface, and allows you to save the raw .xml source file and also export the image (.jpg, .png).

1. Create your image using draw.io
2. Save the file as a .xml
3. Export as your preferred image type.
4. Zip up the .xml file
5. Upload the zipped .xml file to the /Images/xml/ folder; and the .png or .jpg version to /Images **with the same file name**.
6. You can then embed/reference your image on the relevant doc page.
