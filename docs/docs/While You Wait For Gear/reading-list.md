# Reading list

Before you actually install OpenAPS on your rig - perhaps while you're waiting for gear to arrive, or while you're learning to use your new pump or logging data on Nightscout - you should familiarize yourself with the system. 

Here are the most important sections to read:

1. Make sure you know [how you will enter carbs and boluses so OpenAPS knows about them](<../Usage and maintenance/entering-carbs-bolus>). 

2. Read and understand [how OpenAPS decides on adjustments to your basal insulin](<../How it works/understand-determine-basal>).

3. Skim the section on [monitoring OpenAPS](<../Usage and maintenance/monitoring-openaps>) so you're aware of the various options for monitoring your rig once it's looping. It's not necessary to understand all the options in detail, just be aware of them; you'll probably want to return to that section to set up additional options in the future.

4. Skim the section on [preferences and safety settings](<../Usage and maintenance/preferences-and-safety-settings>) you can set so you're aware of the things you can easily adjust. You'll be returning to set these in Step 5 of the installation process. 

5. Skim the section on [your wifi options](<../Usage and maintenance/Wifi/understanding-wifi-options>) to understand the various ways you can get your rig online. Again, you don't need to memorize all the information here, just be aware of the options and ready to return in the future as needed.
