## APS & Diabetes Data Tools

* **\#DIYPS** (http://diyps.org/) - the project and personal experience that inspired #OpenAPS

* **simPancreas** (http://bustavo.com/category/simpancreas/) - another DIY closed loop, although not #OpenAPS related

* **NightScout** (http://www.nightscout.info/) - a visualization and remote monitoring tool for people with diabetes using CGM

* **xDrip** (http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/) - a DIY combination of a device and a software application which receives data sent out by a Dexcom G4 CGM transmitter/sensor and displays the glucose readings on an Android phone 

* **RileyLink** (https://github.com/ps2/rileylink)<br>
A custom designed Bluetooth Smart (BLE) to 916MHz module. It can be used to bridge any BLE capable smartphone to the world of 916Mhz based devices. This project is focused on talking to Medtronic insulin pumps and sensors. There is also a Gitter channel dedicated to discussion on the RileyLink [here](https://gitter.im/ps2/rileylink).

* **Tidepool** (http://tidepool.org/ and https://github.com/tidepool-org)<br>
Notably, work on Boston University iLet UI (https://github.com/tidepool-org/bionicpancreas) and open-source tools for visualization.

* **Perceptus** (http://perceptus.org) - more data visualization tools


# Commercial APS Efforts

There are currently several commercial closed-loop products in development by old and new companies in the diabetes treatment space. These include:

* [Medtronic MiniMed 640G](https://www.medtronic-diabetes.com.au/pump-therapy/640g)
* [Medtronic MiniMed 670G](http://diatribe.org/drugdevice-name/medtronic-minimed-670g)
* [TypeZero Technologies](http://www.typezero.com/)
* [Bigfoot Biomedical](http://www.bigfootbiomedical.com/)
* [Boston University's iLet, formerly known as the "Bionic Pancreas"](http://sites.bu.edu/bionicpancreas/)
