# Troubleshooting

Even those who follow this documentation precisely are bound to end up stuck at some point. This could be due to something unique to your system, a mistyped command, actions performed out of order, or even a typo in this guide. This section provides some tools to help diagnose the issue as well as some common errors that have been experienced and resolved before. If you get stuck, try re-reading the documentation again and after that, share what you've been working on, attempted steps to resolve, and other pertinent details in [#intend-to-bolus in Gitter](https://gitter.im/nightscout/intend-to-bolus) when asking for help troubleshooting.

## Generally useful linux commands

More comprehensive command line references can be found [here](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2598082/linux/linux-linux-command-line-cheat-sheet.html) and [here](http://www.pixelbeat.org/cmdline.html). For the below, since these are basic linux things, also try using a basic search engine (i.e. Google) to learn more about them and their intended use.

`ls -alt` (List all of the files in the current directory with additional details.)

`cd` (Change directory)

`pwd` (Show the present working directory (your current location within the filesystem).)

`sudo <command>`

`tail -f /var/log/syslog`

`grep LOOP /var/log/syslog` (Display lines in file that contain a string, in this example, 'LOOP')

`df -h`

`ifconfig`

`cat <filename>` (Display the contents of the file.)

`nano <filename>` (Open and edit the file in the nano text editor.)

`stat <filename>`

`head <filename>` (Display the beginning of the file.)

`less <filename>` (Display the contents of the file, with advanced navigation)

`pip freeze`

`sudo reboot`

`sudo shutdown -h now` (The correct way to shut down the Raspberry Pi from the command line. Wait for the green light to stop blinking before removing the power supply.)

`dmesg` (Displays all the kernel output since boot. Itâ€™s pretty difficult to read, but sometimes you see things in there about the wifi getting disconnected and so forth.)

`uptime`

`crontab -l` (Display cron jobs)

`sudo service cron status` (Display info on cron service. Also use `stop` and `start`)

[add something for decocare raw logging]

## Dealing with the CareLink USB Stick

The `model` command is a quick way to verify whether you can communicate with the pump. Test this with `openaps use <my_pump_name> model`.

If you can't get a response, it may be a range issue. The range of the CareLink radio is not particularly good, and orientation matters; see [range testing report](https://gist.github.com/channemann/0ff376e350d94ccc9f00) for more information.

If you still can't get a response, trying unplugging and replugging the CareLink stick.

Once you're setting up your loop, you may also want to oref0-reset-usb (`oref0-reset-usb.sh`) if mm-stick warmup fails, to reset the USB connection. It can help in some cases of CareLink stick not responding. Just note that during USB reset you will loose your Wi-Fi connection as well.

## Dealing with a corrupted git repository

OpenAPS uses git as the logging mechanism, so it commits report changes on each report invoke. Sometimes, due to "unexpected" power-offs (battery dying, unplugging, etc.),the git repository gets broken. When it happens you will receive exceptions when running any report from openaps. As git logging is a safety/security measure, there is no way of disabling these commits.

You may see an error that references a loose object, or a corrupted git repository. To fix a corrupted git repository you can run `oref0-reset-git`, which will first run `oref0-fix-git-corruption` to try to fix the repository, and in case when repository is definitely broken it copies the .git history to a temporary location (`tmp`) and initializes a new git repo.

It is recommended to run `oref0-reset-git` in cron so that if the repository gets corrupted it can quickly reset itself. 

Warning: do not run any openaps commands with sudo in front of it `sudo openaps`. If you do, your .git permissions will get messed up. Sudo should only be used when a command needs root permissions, and openaps does not need that. Such permission problems can be corrected by running `sudo chown -R pi.pi .git` in the openaps directory.  If you are using an Intel Edison, run `sudo chown -R edison.users .git`.

## Environment variables

If you are getting your BG from Nightscout or you want to upload loop status/results to Nightscout, among other things you'll need to set 2 environment variables: `NIGHTSCOUT_HOST` and `API_SECRET`. If you do not set and export these variables you will receive errors while running `openaps report invoke monitor/ns-glucose.json` and while executing `ns-upload.sh` script which is most probably part of your `upload-recent-treatments` alias.Make sure your `API_SECRET` is in hashed format. Please see [this page](https://github.com/openaps/oref0#ns-upload-entries) for details. Additionally, your `NIGHTSCOUT_HOST` should be in a format like `http://yourname.herokuapp.com` (without trailing slash). For the complete visualization guide use [this page](https://github.com/openaps/docs/blob/master/docs/Automate-system/vizualization.md) from the OpenAPS documentation.

## Common error messages

**WARNING:** Pay close attention to errors. An error may indicate a serious operational or functional problem with a computer system or component.

These error messages may appear in response to openaps commands in the console, or in the system log (located at /var/log/syslog when using raspbian OS). Some errors can be safely ignored, like timeout errors that occur when the pump is out of range.

### Don't have permission, permission not allowed, etc

The command you are running likely needs to be run with root permissions, try the same command again with ```sudo ``` in front of it

Bash scripts (.sh files) need execute permissions to run. Run this command to grant execute permissions to the owner of a file.

```
chmod u+x myscript.sh
```

### ValueError: need more than 0 values to unpack

A JSON file did not contain entries.

### Unable to upload to http//my-nightscout-website.com

OpenAPS has failed to upload to the configured nightscout website.

### [No JSON object could be decoded](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=active&q=openaps+%27No+JSON+object+could+be+decoded%27)

[to be written]

### json: error: input is not JSON
```
json: error: input is not JSON: Unexpected '<' at line 1, column 1:
        <head><title>Document Moved</title></head>
```

  This error usually comes up when you have pulled a file down from Nightscout that was an invalid file. Typically you might see this when trying to pull down treatments. Make sure that you have your HOST and API_KEY set correctly at the top of your cron, in your ~/.profile

### TypeError: Cannot read property 'zzzz' of undefined

example: `TypeError: Cannot read property 'rate' of undefined`

[to be written]

### Could not parse carbratio_date when invoking profile report

    Could not parse carbratio_data.
    Feature Meal Assist enabled but cannot find required carb_ratios.

This error may occur when you invoke `settings/profile.json` report.

Check report definition in `openaps.ini`. If you have line `remainder = []` change it to `remainder = `

Below is correct definition

    [report "settings/profile.json"]
    use = shell
    bg_targets = settings/bg_targets.json
    settings = settings/settings.json
    basal_profile = settings/basal_profile.json
    reporter = text
    json_default = True
    max_iob = preferences.json
    device = get-profile
    remainder =
    insulin_sensitivities = settings/insulin_sensitivities.json


### CareLink RF timeout errors

Some of these errors represent temporary RF communication errors between the CareLink USB Stick and the pump.

* Stick transmit / LinkStatus:error:True / BAD AILING

  * [to be written]

```
Stick transmit[TransmitPacket:ReadPumpModel:size[64]:data:''] reader[ReadRadio:size:0] download_i[3] status[<LinkStatus:0x03:status:size=??LinkStatus:error:True:reason:[]:size(0)>] poll_size[0] poll_i[False] command[<LinkStatus:0x03:status:size=??LinkStatus:error:True:reason:[]:size(0)>]:download(attempts[3],expect[0],results[0]:data[0]):BAD AILING
```

* size (0) is less than 64 and not 15, which may cause an error.
